                <li>APJ Abdul Kalam's contributions to science, technology, and national development, coupled with his
                    humility and passion for inspiring the youth, have earned him a place of admiration and reverence in
                    the hearts of people across India and the world. Some of his significant contributions include:</li>
                <li>Kalam played a crucial role in the development of India's ballistic missile and space programs. He
                    was the key figure in the successful development of the Agni and Prithvi missiles, which bolstered
                    India's defence capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>As the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the head of the Indian Defense Research
                    and Development Organisation (DRDO), Kalam played a pivotal role in India's successful nuclear tests
                    in Pokhran in 1998, establishing India as a nuclear power.</li>
                <li>Kalam was closely associated with India's space research organization, ISRO (Indian Space Research
                    Organisation). He advocated and supported the development of various satellite launch vehicles,
                    including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle
                    (GSLV).</li>
                <li>Kalam was a visionary leader who articulated the concept of "Vision 2020," a blueprint for
                    transforming India into a developed nation by the year 2020. He emphasized the importance of
                    technology, education, and sustainable development in achieving this goal.</li>
